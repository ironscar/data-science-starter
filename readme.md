# Data Science Starter

- This project is to follow along on Data science courses and take notes on how to do things starting from basics
- Those who take the course can create a folder in their enterprise id and put all their files in there and create a branch to add in to that
- Ever so often, we can merge all of them into `master` with all the folders so people can reference others' work
